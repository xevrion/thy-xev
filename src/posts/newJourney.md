# New Journey
Date: 08-09-2025

Hello to everyone who is reading this! I am very excited to share that today my monitor setup arrived. I have been wanting a dual monitor setup for a long time, and now I finally have it. I mean I already had a monitor which was a bit smaller (19 inch 900p 75hz monitor) but now I have a 27 inch 1440p 180hz (Gigabyte M2QA) monitor as my main monitor and now my laptop sits on the side as a secondary monitor. I am very excited to use this setup for coding, gaming, and general productivity.

And this is a very very smooth experience, but I'm still using it on 144hz, because the true 180hz experience only works through display port, and my laptop only has HDMI output. But I will get a display port to USB-C cable soon, so I can use the full potential of this monitor.

Also, I have a new keyboard which is a AULA F75, which is a mechanical keyboard with blue switches. I am very excited to use this keyboard for coding and gaming. The keyboard has a very nice build quality and the blue switches are very clicky and satisfying to type on.

I'm also thinking of investing in a new gaming mouse, because my current mouse is a normal DELL office mouse, which is good and it worked for about 5-6 years but now the right click is not working properly. So I think it's time to get a new mouse. And I'm thinking of getting the Razer DeathAdder Essential, because it has a very good sensor and it's very comfortable to use.

Overall, I'm very excited about this new setup and I can't wait to use it for coding, gaming, and general productivity. I will keep you all updated on how it goes!
