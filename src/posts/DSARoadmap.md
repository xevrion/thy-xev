# DSA & Competitive Programming Roadmap
Date: 24-02-2026

This is my public roadmap to go from basically nothing to:

- Solving most Leetcode Hards, all Mediums and Easys independently
- Reaching 1600–1800 rating on Codeforces
- Being actually placement-ready

I'm posting this publicly to keep myself accountable. I'll update dates as I complete things.

## Phase 1 — Foundation Repair
*Target: Weeks 1–4*

### C++ STL Mastery

- [x] `vector`, `pair`, `string` — basics and common operations - <span class="blue">24/02/2026</span>
- [x] `map`, `unordered_map` — when to use which, complexity difference - <span class="blue">24/02/2026</span>
- [x] `set`, `multiset`, `unordered_set` - <span class="blue">24/02/2026</span>
- [x] `stack`, `queue`, `deque` - <span class="blue">24/02/2026</span>
- [ ] `priority_queue` — min-heap and max-heap
- [ ] `sort` with custom comparators
- [ ] `lower_bound`, `upper_bound`, `binary_search`
- [ ] `next_permutation`, `accumulate`, `count`, `find`
- [ ] Practice: 10 problems using only STL on Codeforces (800–1000 rating)

### Complexity Analysis

- [ ] Big-O notation — O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²)
- [ ] Can look at any loop structure and instantly state its complexity
- [ ] Understand when a solution will TLE based on constraints (n ≤ 10^5 → O(n log n) max, etc.)

### Arrays & Strings

- [ ] Two pointers technique — opposite ends and same direction
- [ ] Sliding window — fixed size and variable size
- [ ] Prefix sums — 1D and 2D
- [ ] Practice: 15 problems on Leetcode (mix of Easy/Medium)

### Recursion & Backtracking

- [ ] Understand the call stack — trace through recursive calls manually
- [ ] Base case thinking — every recursion problem starts here
- [ ] Classic problems: Fibonacci, factorial, power, reverse array
- [ ] Subsets, permutations, combinations
- [ ] Backtracking: N-Queens, Sudoku solver, rat in a maze
- [ ] Practice: 20 pure recursion + backtracking problems before moving on

### Linked Lists

- [ ] Singly linked list — insert, delete, reverse
- [ ] Fast and slow pointers (Floyd's cycle detection)
- [ ] Merge two sorted lists
- [ ] Find middle, detect loop, remove nth from end
- [ ] Practice: 10 problems on Leetcode

---

## Phase 2 — Core DSA
*Target: Weeks 5–12*

### Stacks & Queues

- [ ] Stack using array and STL
- [ ] Monotonic stack — next greater element, previous smaller element
- [ ] Queue, circular queue, deque
- [ ] Classic problems: valid parentheses, largest rectangle in histogram, sliding window maximum
- [ ] Practice: 12 problems

### Binary Search

- [ ] Binary search on sorted array (the basics)
- [ ] Binary search on answer — this is the real skill
- [ ] Lower bound / upper bound applications
- [ ] Classic problems: search in rotated array, find peak element, Koko eating bananas, aggressive cows
- [ ] Practice: 15 problems

### Heaps (Priority Queue)

- [ ] Min-heap and max-heap internals
- [ ] K largest / K smallest elements
- [ ] Merge K sorted lists
- [ ] Top K frequent elements
- [ ] Practice: 10 problems

### Trees

- [ ] Binary tree traversals — inorder, preorder, postorder (recursive + iterative)
- [ ] Level order traversal (BFS on trees)
- [ ] Height, diameter, depth of binary tree
- [ ] Lowest common ancestor (LCA)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree — insert, delete, search, validate
- [ ] Path sum problems
- [ ] Serialize and deserialize
- [ ] Practice: 30 problems (this is non-negotiable before graphs)

### Graphs

- [ ] Graph representation — adjacency list vs matrix
- [ ] BFS — shortest path in unweighted graph
- [ ] DFS — connected components, cycle detection
- [ ] Topological sort (Kahn's algorithm + DFS approach)
- [ ] Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) — with path compression and union by rank
- [ ] Dijkstra's algorithm — shortest path in weighted graph
- [ ] Bellman-Ford (for negative weights)
- [ ] Minimum spanning tree — Kruskal's and Prim's
- [ ] Practice: 25 problems (topic-wise, one algorithm at a time)

### Dynamic Programming

- [ ] 1D DP — climbing stairs, house robber, jump game
- [ ] 2D DP — grid paths, unique paths, minimum path sum
- [ ] Knapsack — 0/1 knapsack, unbounded knapsack
- [ ] String DP — longest common subsequence, edit distance, longest palindromic subsequence
- [ ] DP on trees
- [ ] Bitmask DP (intro)
- [ ] Practice: 30 problems — never memorize, always derive the recurrence yourself

## Phase 3 — Leetcode Grind
*Target: Weeks 8–20 (overlaps with Phase 2)*

## Rules I'm Following

- Minimum 30–45 minutes of genuine struggle before looking at any hint
- No copy-pasting solutions to maintain streaks — if I can't solve it, I upsolve it properly
- Every new topic: learn theory first, then immediately do 10+ problems on that topic
- After every contest: upsolve every problem I couldn't solve during the contest
- Update this post with dates every time a checkbox gets ticked
