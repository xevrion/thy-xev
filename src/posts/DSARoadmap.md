# DSA & Competitive Programming Roadmap
Date: 24-02-2026

This is my public roadmap to go from basically nothing to:

- Solving most Leetcode Hards, all Mediums and Easys independently
- Reaching 1600–1800 rating on Codeforces
- Being actually placement-ready

I'm posting this publicly to keep myself accountable. I'll update dates as I complete things.

- [ ] Lowest common ancestor (LCA)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree — insert, delete, search, validate
- [ ] Path sum problems
- [ ] Serialize and deserialize
- [ ] Practice: 30 problems (this is non-negotiable before graphs)

### Graphs

- [ ] Graph representation — adjacency list vs matrix
- [ ] BFS — shortest path in unweighted graph
- [ ] DFS — connected components, cycle detection
- [ ] Topological sort (Kahn's algorithm + DFS approach)
- [ ] Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) — with path compression and union by rank
- [ ] Dijkstra's algorithm — shortest path in weighted graph
- [ ] Bellman-Ford (for negative weights)
- [ ] Minimum spanning tree — Kruskal's and Prim's
- [ ] Practice: 25 problems (topic-wise, one algorithm at a time)

### Dynamic Programming

- [ ] 1D DP — climbing stairs, house robber, jump game
- [ ] 2D DP — grid paths, unique paths, minimum path sum

- [ ] String DP — longest common subsequence, edit distance, longest palindromic subsequence
- [ ] DP on trees
- [ ] Bitmask DP (intro)
- [ ] Practice: 30 problems — never memorize, always derive the recurrence yourself

## Rules I'm Following

- Minimum 30–45 minutes of genuine struggle before looking at any hint
- No copy-pasting solutions to maintain streaks — if I can't solve it, I upsolve it properly
- Every new topic: learn theory first, then immediately do 10+ problems on that topic
- After every contest: upsolve every problem I couldn't solve during the contest
- Update this post with dates every time a checkbox gets ticked
